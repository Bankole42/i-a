    <p class="description">
        Hanky Panky is an animated short film about a phone call between 27-year old Osas and her favourite aunty, Yuwa.
        <br/>
        In this three-minute slice of life, Aunty Yuwa calls her niece to complain about flirty birthday pictures recently posted to Instagram.
        <br/>
        Osas is on a drive with friends when the call comes in. The conversation starts out jovial but gets increasingly heated as Aunty Yuwa insists something fishy is going on.
        <br/>
        This is the first film in Go Slow, an upcoming animated series about the vastly different lives that converge in Lagos traffic.
