						<p>There's very little institutional support for the arts in Nigeria. A lot of talented people have great ideas but can't afford to bring them to life.</p>
						<p>Independent Arts is a network of people, ideas, and resources to keep our most precious dreams alive. Simply put, we help artists make passion projects.</p>
						<p>We started out in 2021 as an experimental studio. After three years and seven projects, we've come to understanding of what it means to support the arts.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>1. Fund creative projects to nurture emerging talent</li>
							<li>2. Connect artists to great people and ideas</li>
							<li>3. Create platforms to document new culture</li>
							<li>4. Produce events to celebrate excellent work</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Our vision is expansive, but we're starting small.</p>
						<p>Our flagship project is an animated series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLyhQhYlxBA">E Dey Happen</a>.</p>
