			<h1>Manifesto</h1>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Thesis</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>A lot of talented artists and directors in Nigeria have great ideas but no time, money or support to bring them to life.</li>
				<li>Most of our cultural production is commercial, and there’s low institutional support for passion projects with high cultural value.</li>
				<li>There’s a global audience for high quality projects. Thanks to the internet, music and migration, there’s a huge demand for Nigerian culture in the world.</li>
				<li>If we reach enough people and move the right audience, we can crowdfund money to run the studio.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Production</h4>
			<p>By making things we get to understand the creative industry and build capacity to help others.</p>
			<p>The core team is very small, supported by a network of friends and collaborators. We hire independent consultants for each project and work remotely using Basecamp, Notion and WhatsApp.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Distribution</h4>
			<p>If a community-funded, volunteer-run support system for indie creators is to exist, we need way more people to know about it. If we make quality projects, with intentional marketing and consistent press, we can attract a global audience of enthusiasts.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Funding</h4>
			<p>Hopefully, we find <a class="c-link c-link--out" href="https://future.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/" target="_blank">100 true fans</a> in this audience to crowdfund studio operations. We also hope raise money through grants and product sales.</p>
