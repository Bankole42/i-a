			<h1>Manifesto</h1>
			<p>The name <span class="wrwr">wuruwuru</span> refers to the process of making things in Nigeria - helplessly independent, heavily constrained, very random and often improvised.</p>
			<p>This project is no different - first it was an attempt to make a magazine, then it veered into an Instagram comic, then an animated short, and now a handful of odd publishing experiments.</p>
			<p>The idea is to, by working on these different things, build a creative community and create virtual space for independent creators to play and learn.</p>
			<p>We’re also hoping to make some really cool products. With each title, we’re experimenting with new format, new stories and documenting as much as we can.</p>
			<p>Long term, the goal is to support other people to make their own cool ideas. Here’s how we’re thinking about it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Produce some projects</li>
				<li>Build an editorial platform</li>
				<li>Build a paying audience</li>
				<li>Support other creators</li>
			</ol>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Production</h4>
			<p>First, we're making some of our own ideas. Making will help us build the network and know-how to help others.</p>
			<p>Our first collection of projects includes an Instagram comic, some databases, an animated short, a web series, a board game, and a book.</p>
			<p>With each project, the goal is to create a new type of story, build a community of makers, and create useful documentation. We're looking to publish all six projects by February 2023.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Editorial</h4>
			<p>Next, we'll try to build a global audience through publishing.</p>
			<p>We'll start with the people who come for our projects and build a relationship with them. We'll publish and syndicate insightful content on a regular schedule, and hope to build a global audience as a result.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Funding</h4>
			<p>Currently self-funded, the long-term plan for sustainability is to crowdfund operations for the studio.</p>
			<p>We believe it can work because the stars are aligned. Thanks to music, Nigeria has the attention of the world. Thanks to technology, it's never been easier to move money internationally. And social media distribution for independent creators keeps getting better.</p>
			<p>Hopefully, we can get <a class="c-link c-link--out" href="https://future.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/" target="_blank">100 True Fans</a> from our audience to commit some money to indie creators every year.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Support</h4>
			<p>If this all works, we can then support creators by designing programs with established institutions. Partners will provide physical space, which will help keep our overhead low.</P>
