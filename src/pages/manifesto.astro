			<h1>Manifesto</h1>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Thesis</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>A lot of talented artists and directors in Nigeria have great ideas for keystone projects but no time, money or support to bring them to life.</li>
				<li>Most of our cultural production is commercial because of the economic incentives, and there’s little or no institutional support for projects with high cultural value.</li>
				<li>There’s a global audience for well-made Nigerian products. Thanks to the internet, music and migration, there’s a huge demand for our culture in the world.</li>
				<li>If we make spirited works of art, show it to enough people and move the right audience, we can crowdfund enough money to run the studio.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Production</h4>
			<p>By making things we get to understand the creative industry and build capacity to help others. Keep the core team small, supported by a network of friends and collaborators. Hire independent consultants for each project and work remotely like a modern software company.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Distribution</h4>
			<p>If this community-funded, volunteer-run support system for independent creators is to exist, we need way more people to know about it. With intentional marketing and consistent publishing, we can attract a global audience of enthusiasts.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Funding</h4>
			<p>Hopefully, we find <a class="c-link c-link--out" href="https://future.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/" target="_blank">100 true fans</a> in this audience to be consistent patrons. We also hope raise money through grants and product sales.</p>
