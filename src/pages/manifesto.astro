			<h1><i>Manifesto</i></h1>
			<p><span class="wrwr">wuruwuru</span> means crooked.</p>
			<p>The experiment started out as an attempt to make a magazine, but then veered into an Instagram comic, an animated short, and a handful of other stories and visual projects.</p>
			<p>Eventually, the idea morphed into a support system for independent creators to produce capstone projects. A lot of people don't have the time or money to create personal ideas with high cultural value.</p>
			<p>We're thinking about it like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Produce some projects</li>
				<li>Create a platform</li>
				<li>Build a paying audience</li>
				<li>Support other creators</li>
			</ol>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Production</h4>
			<p>Making things will help us understand how to help other creators. Our first collection of projects includes an Instagram comic, some databases, an animated short, a web series, a board game, and a book.</p>
			<p>With each project, the goal is to create a new type of story, build a community of makers, and create useful documentation.</p>
			<p>We're looking to publish all six projects by February 2023.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Platform</h4>
			<p>Next, we can use our content to kickstart a publishing platform e.g. a physical magazine or an online publication.</p>
			<p>Thanks to music and technology, Nigeria has a lot of attention. With this platform, niche storytelling, high quality visual content and social media, we can build a global audience.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Audience</h4>
			<p>We can try to get <a href="https://future.com/1000-true-fans-try-100/" target="_blank">100 True Fans</a> from our audience to commit some money to indie creators every year.</p>
			<h4 class="c-section-title">Support</h4>
			<p>We can then support creators by designing and funding programs in established institutions. Our partners will provide space, people and operations, which really cuts our cost.</P>
