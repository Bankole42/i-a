Cover Bank, a digital archive showcasing over 5,300 Nigerian album covers from 1980 to the present day, has launched a significant update to its platform, making it even easier for users to explore the vast history of Nigerian music and graphic design.

With its broad selection of covers, the Album Cover Bank platform serves as an essential tool for artists, enthusiasts, educators, and researchers worldwide, helping users appreciate the historical and artistic significance of Nigerian graphic design.
