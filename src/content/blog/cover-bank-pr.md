Cover Bank, a digital archive showcasing over 5,300 Nigerian album covers from 1980 to the present day, has launched a significant update to its platform, making it even easier for users to explore the vast history of Nigerian music and graphic design.

This latest update introduces a revamped filter functionality to streamline the user experience. This allows users to navigate the Cover Bank archive more intuitively, providing faster and more efficient access to specific album covers and historical information.

Built by Helloworld, a technology studio for cultural production, and sponsored by Independent Arts, a studio dedicated to passion projects, Cover Bank provides a unique lens into the evolution of Nigerian music culture through album cover art.

Each cover in this expansive archive represents the vision of Nigerian artists whose work capture the essence of Nigerian music, from Highlife and Afrobeat to Hip-hop and Afrobeats. These artists have shaped the cultural identity of their time through album artwork.

With its broad selection of covers, the Album Cover Bank platform serves as an essential tool for artists, enthusiasts, educators, and researchers worldwide, helping users appreciate the historical and artistic significance of Nigerian graphic design.
