            <p>Wuruwuru is a collection of random publishing experiments, each one made with a different set of friends and freelancers.</p>
            <p>I'm doing this for three reasons:</p>
            <p>First, to produce high quality content like the ones I consume e.g. <a href="https://pudding.cool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pudding</a>, <a href="https://psyche.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psyche</a> and <a href="https://www.adultswim.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adult Swim</a>. I've followed them for many years and they do such good work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to work with freelancers and document my experience of the Nigerian creative industry.</p>
            <p>Finally, I get to both participate in and support independent creation, which I really believe in.</p>
            <p>I called it Wuruwuru because it's a trial and error approach to publishing, but hopefully we make some great stories. Enjoy!</p>
